# Guess-My-Number
The project is a game called **"Guess My Number"** that tests the player's ability to guess a random number between 1 and 20 in a limited number of attempts. The HTML file contains the layout and elements of the game, including the header, the main section with two subsections for user input and game information. The CSS file defines the style and layout of the game elements, including fonts, colors, and sizes. The JavaScript file implements the game logic, generating a secret number, receiving and checking user input, updating the score and highscore, and displaying messages and feedback to the user.
